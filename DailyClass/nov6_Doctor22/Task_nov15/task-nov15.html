        game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike
        come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and
        his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become
        somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a
        repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited
        amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when
        you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely
        if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect
        yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English.

        info:\n\nMinecraft now comes with the option to buy Minecraft Realms. Realms is a monthly subscription service
        that lets you create your own always-online Minecraft world.\nThere are currently two subscription options to
        choose from depending on how many people you want to invite to play in your realm simultaneously. A realm for
        you and 2 friends costs 3.99 USD/month (or local equivalent) and a realm for you and 10 friends cost 7.99
        USD/month (or local equivalent).\nA 30-day trial of Minecraft Realms for you and 10 friends is available. Any
        unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription.\n\nThe payment
        will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and the subscription automatically renews
        unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be
        charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, at the subscription price option you
        have previously selected.\n\nYour subscription can be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by
        going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. There is also a button in-game that take you to these
        settings. If you cancel after your subscription has activated, you won't be refunded for the remaining active
        period of the subscription.\n\nHere are links to our privacy policy and terms of use:\n- Privacy policy:

        pick-up or release shifts with one click. Work-life balance is easily managed with automatic shift pick ups when
        you want more hours, and time off requests for when you don’t. Calendar sync and notifications keep your
        Schedules and the roster automatically updated to your phone with any manager-approved changes.\n\nManagers
        appreciate the 75% time savings when building schedules and one-click approvals for shift changes. The ability
        to monitor business performance with sales and labor snapshots from anywhere, keeps them out of the back office.
        And most importantly, staying connected with broadcast and one-to-one messaging makes for a happy and productive
        team culture.\n \nNOTE: The HotSchedules application REQUIRES a valid HotSchedules user account through your

        "label": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and
        controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront
        ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island! You'll need to
        whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding
        whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll
        need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm
        of your hand. Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby. Switch to the Build Station
        to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae. Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended
        just right. Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky
        customers. Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the
        sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up. As your level rises,
        you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria! A well-crafted
        sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR
        PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your
        fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using
        buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs. You can also use buttons in the top corners to
        quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy
        reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens. The Pour
        Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and
        tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view. When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the
        entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've
        fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens. Once you purchase the Blend
        Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender. Booster Buttons are also large
        and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The
        Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!
        Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring
        toppings evenly across the sundae. You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and
        cookies. And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the
        cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new
        ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped
        cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game. There's over 70 unique ingredients
        for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n-
        All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and
        topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n-
        Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD
        USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens. If you're looking for
        large-screen gameplay, check out \"Papa's Freezeria HD\" for iPad!"

        combative motorsport game out there. \n\n• Unique Racing Experience – Exhilarating no-rules racing action with

        intersections and oncoming traffic, or go for demolition dominance in derby arenas.\n\n• Awesome Cars – Our cars

        friends in local multiplayer and take racing to the limit while chasing for demolition dominance!\n\n• Challenge

        sleep & quality and send you a notification in the morning.\n\nEven if you don't wear your Watch to bed,
        AutoSleep can track your time in bed. It's extremely simple. If you DON'T wear your Watch to bed, then simply
        take your Watch off before you go to sleep. As soon as you touch your iPhone or put your Watch back on in the
        morning then AutoSleep will know that you have finished sleeping. \n\nAs everyone is a little bit different.
        AutoSleep provides a simple setup wizard and an option to tweak if you are a very restless sleeper.
        \n\nAutoSleep also integrates beautifully with the Eclipse Yourself and HeartWatch apps, our premier heart,
        health, activity, recovery and readiness monitoring apps.\n\n*Requires Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or
        higher.\n\nAwards\n-----------------\nBest of 2018\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1438574124/\n\nBest of
